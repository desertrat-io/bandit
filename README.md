# Bandit

## Image Theft Detection and Notification

Bandit seeks to borrow some of the ideas from an old project from the now defunct company
The Commission Caf√©. Initially a value added feature, the project uses machine learning to
help identify the theft of artwork from whichever artist decides to use it in order to notify them
as well as give steps to remedy the situation. If a violation is detected, the artist or owner
of the property will have the opportunity to review, and if necessary take the fullest action
determined to be possible based on the location of the image.

## Where are we right now?

I've got a lot going on at present, so right now it's just some basic setup while
I figure out where to go. This is kind of a warmup project to do while getting
ready for my main work.
